<p>Take a look at this partial implementation of a system with support for byte-sized memory accesses. The attacker and the victim program do not share memory, but they do use the same direct-mapped cache which has a size of 32 bytes and a block size of 1 byte. The victim program leaks the secret <code>FLAG</code> via a cache side channel. Your task is to determine the value of <code>FLAG</code> by performing memory accesses and running the victim program. Use your browser console to make <code>await sys.attackerAccess()</code> and <code>await sys.victimProgram()</code> function calls and capture the flag!</p>
<p>For information on caches, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQ_LEzqQlrrOkQiXf-RAeiFgP9ADFlmkepMFMwEf8UI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note that it is necessary to include the <code>await</code> keyword in front of the function calls for proper behavior.</strong></p>

<code>
const FLAG;

const MEMORY_SIZE = 128;
const VICTIM_MEMORY_START = 0;
const VICTIM_MEMORY_END = 64;
const ATTACKER_MEMORY_START = 64;
const ATTACKER_MEMORY_END = 128;

const CACHE_SIZE = 32;

class System {
  async attackerAccess(address) {
    if (address < ATTACKER_MEMORY_START || address >= ATTACKER_MEMORY_END) {
      console.log("SEGMENTATION FAULT");
      return;
    }
    return await this.access(address);
  }

  async victimProgram() {
    for (let i = 0; i < FLAG.length; i++) {
      let char = FLAG.charAt(i);
      let address = char.charCodeAt() - 65;
      let value = await this.victimAccess(address);

<p>Hint 0: Which cache blocks are used when different memory addresses are accessed? Read through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQ_LEzqQlrrOkQiXf-RAeiFgP9ADFlmkepMFMwEf8UI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">information on caches</a> if you're not sure.</p>
<p>Hint 1: Begin by "priming" the cache, filling the cache with known memory blocks using <code>await sys.attackerAccess()</code> calls. Notice that a cache miss takes 3 seconds to retrieve the block from main memory, but each subsequent access of the same block is immediate since it is a cache hit.</p>
<p>Hint 2: Call <code>await sys.victimProgram()</code> to run the victim program, which replaces certain cache blocks based on the value of <code>FLAG</code>.</p>
<p>Hint 3: "Probe" the cache by making <code>await sys.attackerAccess()</code> calls and observing how long they take. If an access takes 3 seconds, the block must have been replaced by the victim program and needed to be retrieved again from main memory.</p>
<p>Hint 4: Figure out which cache blocks are associated with which characters and unscramble the letters to find <code>FLAG</code>'s value!</p>
