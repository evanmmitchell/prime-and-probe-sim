Take a look at this partial implementation of a system with support for byte-sized memory accesses. The attacker and the victim program do not share memory, but they do use the same direct-mapped cache with a size of 32 bytes and a block size of 1 byte. The victim program leaks the secret <code>FLAG</code> via a cache side channel. Your tasks is to determine the value of <code>FLAG</code> by performing memory accesses and running the victim program. Use your browser console to make <code>sys.attackerAccess()</code> and <code>sys.victimProgram()</code> function calls and capture the flag!

    if (address < ATTACKER_MEMORY_START || address >= ATTACKER_MEMORY_END) {

      return;
    }
    return this.#access(address);
  }

  victimProgram() {
    for (let i = 0; i < FLAG.length; i++) {
      this.#victimAccess(FLAG[i].charCodeAt() - 65);
    }
    console.log("VICTIM PROGRAM COMPLETE");

Hint 1: Begin by "priming" the cache, or filling the cache with known memory blocks, using <code>sys.attackerAccess()</code> calls. Notice that each initial access takes 3 seconds to retrieve the block from main memory, but each further access of the same block is much faster since it is stored in the cache.

Hint 2: Call <code>sys.victimProgram()</code> to run the victim program, which replaces certain cache blocks based on the value of <code>FLAG</code>.

Hint 3: "Probe" the cache by making <code>sys.attackerAccess()</code> calls and observing how long they take. If an access takes 3 seconds, the block must have been replaced by the victim program and needed to be retrieved again from main memory.

Hint 4: Figure out which cache blocks are associated with which characters and unscramble the letters to find <code>FLAG</code>'s value!
