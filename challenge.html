Take a look at this partial implementation of a system with support for byte-sized memory accesses. The attacker and the victim program do not share memory, but they do use the same direct-mapped cache which has a size of 32 bytes and a block size of 1 byte. The victim program leaks the secret <code>FLAG</code> via a cache side channel. Your task is to determine the value of <code>FLAG</code> by performing memory accesses and running the victim program. Use your browser console to make <code>sys.attackerAccess()</code> and <code>sys.victimProgram()</code> function calls and capture the flag!

    for (let i = 0; i < FLAG.length; i++) {
      let char = FLAG.charAt(i);
      let address = char.charCodeAt() - 65;
      let value = this.victimAccess(address);

Hint 0: Which cache blocks are used when different memory addresses are accessed? Read through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KQ_LEzqQlrrOkQiXf-RAeiFgP9ADFlmkepMFMwEf8UI/edit?usp=sharing">information on caches</a> if you're not sure.

Hint 1: Begin by "priming" the cache, filling the cache with known memory blocks using <code>sys.attackerAccess()</code> calls. Notice that a cache miss takes 3 seconds to retrieve the block from main memory, but each subsequent access of the same block is immediate since it is a cache hit.

Hint 2: Call <code>sys.victimProgram()</code> to run the victim program, which replaces certain cache blocks based on the value of <code>FLAG</code>.

Hint 3: "Probe" the cache by making <code>sys.attackerAccess()</code> calls and observing how long they take. If an access takes 3 seconds, the block must have been replaced by the victim program and needed to be retrieved again from main memory.

Hint 4: Figure out which cache blocks are associated with which characters and unscramble the letters to find <code>FLAG</code>'s value!
